# Interpolation
Let's dive into the world where we make the data feel that they belong to someting(some function).

# Introduction

Lets understand what interpolation is. Given data $(x_i, y_i), i = 0, 1, 2, 3,....,n$ we have to find a function $f$ such that $f(x_i)$ is called interpolating function, the problem is called interpolating problem and the method/process is called interpolation. 

It is used to plot a smooth curve through discrete data points, when we want to find the in-between values function in a table, or when we differentiate or integrate black-box type functions.

So, to justify the discrete point we need function but how to get that function. Examples of functions used in interpolations are:

- Polynomial
- Piecewise polynomial
- Rational functions,
- Trigonometric functions
- Exponential functions

$$
P(x) = \frac{1}{\sigma\sqrt{2\pi}} e^{\frac{-(x-\mu)^2}{2\sigma^2}}
$$
